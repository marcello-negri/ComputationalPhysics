## Description

In this task I performed a Diffusion Limited Aggregation on a two dimensional space. The process describes how particles aggregate into a cluster in cases where the **single particle diffusion** is the dominating mechanism. Firstly, I simulated the DLA process on a **square lattice** (DLA.py) and secondly I generalised it to **continuous space** (DLA_extra.py). In both cases a **fractal structure** appears, which can be visualised in results.pdf.
