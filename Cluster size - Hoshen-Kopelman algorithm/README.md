## Description

In this task I studied the cluster size distribution of a system of subject to **percolation** behaviour (e.g. forest fire). In order to do so, I exploited the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm which is a very efficient to determine which sites belong to each cluster. Efficiently, the algorithm goes through the system once only and for this reason is extremely helpful to investigate very large systems as well. I plotted in results.pdf the cluster size distribution for different **occupation probabilities** either below or above the critical one.
