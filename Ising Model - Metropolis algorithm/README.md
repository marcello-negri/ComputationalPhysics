## Description

In this task I implemented a **Monte Carlo** simulation of the 2D Ising model using the single-spin flip Metropolis algorithm. This method can be seen as a **Markov chain** since the probability of transitioning to the next state depends on the present state only. In particular, I exploited the model to compute and plot the average energy as well as the magnetization as a function of the temperature T. These quantities are of physical interest as they show peculiar **phase transitions** shown in results.pdf.
